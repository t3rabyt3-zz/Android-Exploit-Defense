# Android Exploit Defense #

My project is about Android Exploit Defense & Security. This repository provides
APIs and scripts for static analysis. Most of the codes are written in
Python for rapid development.

## Overview ##

The workflow of static analysis is the same as most of machine learning
applications: acquire a dataset, extract features, and classify the 
samples.

### Dataset Acquisition ###

There are several ways to get APK files. You can download them either from 
[Google Play][1] or from thrid-party app stores like [Wandoujia][2]. Extra
tools may be needed to download APK files from Google Play such as
[APKs Downloader][3]. Note the daily quota of a Google account is about 300
to 500 APK files. It takes over a month to collect ten thousand apps by a
single account.

After downloading, we should label the APK files as malicious or benign.
Some papers trust all the samples from Google Play as benign, and use the
malicious dataset provided by [Android Malware Genome Project][5].
However, this scheme is too coarse since malicious applications may exist
in Google Play. Google Bouncer is not almighty.

[VirusTotal][4] is another common way to do this job. It provdes a public
API to scan arbitrary files online by several anti-virus scanners. A paper
[Drebin][6] labels the applications as malicious that are detected by at
least two of the ten common scanners, and combines them with
[Android Malware Genome Project][5]. Another paper [MAMA][7] controls the
detection ratio of all the scanners empirically.

### Feature Extraction ###

Everything in an APK file can be a feature. The most basic and common
features are permissions and APIs. The latter has dominated for almost two
years due to its granularity.

You can use either Python-based [Androguard][8] or Java-based [Baksmali][9] 
to disassemble the APK files, and get the features needed. I choose the
former one because writting Python scripts is more intuitive for me.

### Classification ###

There are many algorithms that can be applied like Bayesian networks,
support vector machines (SVMs), J48, and etc. You can implement those
algorithms yourself. However, as a programmer, I suggest you using
libraries like [scikit-learn][10] (Python-based) and [Weka][11]
(Java-based). Never reinvent the wheel, dude.

If you have not decided which algorithm to use yet, I recommend Weka as a
start point. It provides a great GUI so that you can do lots of stuff
simply by a mouse, which is conveninent for trial at the beginning. You
can also write your complex classification system with Java-based Weka API
if you are a Java fan.

## Development Environment ##

* Ubuntu 14.04 & PostgreSQL 9.3.5

  You can use Ubuntu 14.10, too. CentOS 7 and Fedora 20 are also good
  options. Note that CentOS 6.5 may need [virtualenv][12] as it use stable
  but older libraries, which made me feel a bit annoyed every time I
  started a `screen` session.

* Python 2.7.6

  Three two python modules, `psycopg` and `poster`, are needed for
  database manipulation and uploading files via HTTP, respectively. Use
  `apt-get` to install them:
  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-poster
  ```

* Androguard 1.9

  To install [Androguard][8], make a local clone on your computer:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/androguard/androguard
  ```

  Do not forget to add the path to `PYTHONPATH` in yoru `bashrc`:
  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/androguard:$PYTHONPATH
  ```

* Weka 3.6.11

  After download Weka, change into the directory and type the following
  command to execute ti:
  ```bash
  $ java -Xmx1000M -jar weka.jar
  ```
  Note that using `-jar` will override `CLASSPATH` variable and only use
  `weka.jar`. By the way, I prefer another way. First Add the path to
  `CLASSPATH` in `bashrc`:
  ```bash
  export CLASSPATH=/path/to/weka:$CLASSPATH
  ```
  Later you can run the program everywhere:
  ```bash
  $ java weka.gui.GUIChooser
  # or java weka.gui.Main
  ```
  If your operating system is Ubuntu, you will find it convenient with its
  tab-completion. Finally, do not forget to add SVM Java libary to
  `CLASSPATH` variable if you need it.
